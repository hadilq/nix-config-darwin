# nix-config-darwin

This is my configuraton of nix package manager in MacOS. First I installed

```
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume
```

As you can find in [Nix manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sect-macos-installation). Then installed [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

You can repeate it as the selling point of nix is being repeatable.
